Have you ever wondered how accurate Javascript's `Math.random()` function actually is?

I thought about this the other day, so i decided to make a small experiment to find out.

ðŸ§ª You can try it out yourself [HERE](https://boguz.github.io/js-math-random-test/)

## ðŸ§  Some kind of conclusion
Depending on sample size, i was actually surprised to how random the results were.

With a small sample size (for instance just 100 tests), i got percentages as low as 5% and as high as 17% for each value (10 values in total).

But as i got to higher samples sizes (for instance 1.000.000) i got consistently values between 9.92% and 10.08%.

I have made these test using Chrome. As i understand it, it is actually the browser that implements how the `Math.random()` works, so there may be some differences between the browsers. It would be nice to test this some day...

Here are some cool articles i found about this subject:

## ðŸ¦º Disclaimer
This isn't scientific in any way, and there are many factors that can influence the results you get. This was just a fun little weekend project of mine, so please take the results and my conclusion for what they are...
